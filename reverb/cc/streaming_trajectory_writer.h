// A streaming trajectory writer behaves similarly to the "standard" trajectory
// writer. It allows creating replay items of arbitrary length (i.e. the
// trajectory length doesn't need to be specified in advance). Many
// (overlapping) items can be created per episode.
//
// The major difference between `StreamingTrajectoryWriter` and
// `TrajectoryWriter` is how and when data is sent to the replay buffer. This
// class sends chunks as soon as they have reached a specified length (called
// chunk size) whereas `TrajectoryWriter` only sends chunks when they are
// referenced by a priority item. Especially when doing full-episode replay,
// trajectories can become very long, which leads to memory issues on the
// writing side if the entire trajectory is kept in memory until the priority
// item is created. In these situations, `StreamingTrajectoryWriter` can reduce
// memory consumption on the writing side. Note, however, that using long
// episodes may still pose problems on the reading side where the entire
// trajectory must be kept in memory.
//
// The downside of using `StreamingTrajectoryWriter` is that it does not
// gracefully recover from data loss. If streaming a chunk belonging to an
// episode fails, the write call will not be retried. Instead, the entire
// episode is considered corrupt and no priority items can be created until a
// new episode is started. If an episode is corrupt, calls for adding additional
// tensors or creating priority items will return an `absl::DataLossError`.
// Callers should start a new episode when they observe the error.
//
// This class is not thread-safe.
//
// TODO(b/143277674): Consolidate this implementation with TrajectoryWriter.
